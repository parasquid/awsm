# Protocol Outcomes and Error Specification

**Document:** `specifications/protocol/errors.md`

**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Draft

**Depends On:**

- protocol.md
- messages.md

---

# 1. Purpose

This specification defines protocol outcomes, retry behavior, and error reporting.

Every protocol request SHALL produce exactly one Outcome.

Outcomes are transport-independent.

---

# 2. Design Goals

The outcome model MUST provide:

- deterministic client behavior
- retry guidance
- forward compatibility
- machine-readable responses
- human-readable diagnostics

---

# 3. Outcome Structure

Every Outcome SHALL contain:

- Outcome Code
- Outcome Category
- Retry Recommendation

Optional:

- Reason
- Details
- Related Object Identifier

---

# 4. Outcome Categories

The standard categories are:

SUCCESS

RETRY

REJECTED

FATAL

UNKNOWN

Future categories MAY be introduced.

---

# 5. SUCCESS

The requested operation completed.

Examples:

- Object accepted
- Download completed
- Authentication successful

Clients SHOULD continue normal processing.

---

# 6. RETRY

The request was not completed.

Retry may succeed.

Examples:

- temporary storage unavailable
- network interruption
- lock contention
- server overload

Clients SHOULD retry according to server guidance.

---

# 7. REJECTED

The request was understood but cannot succeed without modification.

Examples:

- invalid schema
- authorization failure
- malformed object
- unsupported protocol feature

Automatic retry SHOULD NOT occur.

---

# 8. FATAL

The session cannot continue.

Examples:

- protocol violation
- integrity failure
- cryptographic failure
- unrecoverable corruption

Clients SHOULD terminate the current session.

---

# 9. UNKNOWN

The receiver cannot classify the request.

Clients SHOULD log the outcome.

---

# 10. Retry Recommendations

Retry recommendations include:

NEVER

IMMEDIATE

EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF

AFTER_TIMESTAMP

MANUAL

Clients SHOULD honor retry recommendations.

---

# 11. Standard Outcome Codes

Examples:

OBJECT_ACCEPTED

OBJECT_ALREADY_EXISTS

OBJECT_NOT_FOUND

OBJECT_CORRUPTED

SCHEMA_INVALID

CHECKSUM_FAILED

AUTHENTICATION_FAILED

DEVICE_REVOKED

PROTOCOL_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED

QUOTA_EXCEEDED

SERVER_BUSY

RATE_LIMITED

UNKNOWN_OBJECT_TYPE

UNKNOWN_MESSAGE_TYPE

VAULT_GENERATION_SUPERSEDED

Future codes MAY be introduced.

`VAULT_GENERATION_SUPERSEDED` is stable. It means the submitted authoritative work names a generation that is no longer active. The client MUST NOT retry that history against the new generation as an automatic merge.

---

# 12. Diagnostics

Human-readable diagnostics MAY be included.

Clients MUST NOT parse diagnostic text.

Clients SHALL rely upon Outcome Codes.

---

# 13. Unknown Codes

Unknown Outcome Codes MUST be preserved.

Clients SHOULD treat unknown codes conservatively.

---

# 14. Invariants

Outcome Codes are stable.

Diagnostics are optional.

Machine-readable fields are normative.
