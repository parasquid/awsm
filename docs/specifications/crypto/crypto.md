# Cryptography Specification

**Document:** `specifications/crypto/crypto.md`

**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Draft

---

# 1. Purpose

This specification defines the cryptographic primitives, formats, and rules used by the Archive Platform.

It defines how data is encrypted, authenticated, and verified across all system components.

---

# 2. Design Goals

Cryptography MUST provide:

- confidentiality
- integrity
- authenticity
- forward secrecy (where applicable)
- key separation
- algorithm agility
- zero-knowledge server model

---

# 3. Non-Goals

This specification does NOT define:

- user authentication UI
- identity management UX
- password policies
- transport security (TLS is assumed separately)

---

# 4. Cryptographic Primitives

The platform SHALL use the following primitives:

## 4.1 Encryption

- Algorithm: XChaCha20-Poly1305
- Purpose: symmetric authenticated encryption
- Mode: AEAD

## 4.2 Hashing

- Algorithm: SHA-256

## 4.3 Key Derivation

- Algorithm: HKDF-SHA256

## 4.4 Export Passphrase KDF

- Algorithm: Argon2id

## 4.5 Local Device Key Wrapping

- Algorithm: AES-KW with a 256-bit non-exportable Web Crypto key
- Purpose: wrap the Vault Root Key for the local browser device slot

AES-KW is limited to local device key slots. It is not an Object encryption algorithm and SHALL NOT be used to encrypt Bundle, Event, Projection, or synchronized payload bytes.

## 4.6 Digital Signatures

- Algorithm: Ed25519

---

# 5. Algorithm Identifiers

All cryptographic operations MUST be tagged with algorithm identifiers.

Examples:

```
enc:xchacha20poly1305:v1
hash:sha256:v1
kdf:hkdf-sha256:v1
sig:ed25519:v1
wrap:aes-kw-256:device:v1
wrap:xchacha20poly1305:passphrase:v1
```

---

# 6. Encryption Model

All sensitive data MUST be encrypted before leaving trusted client environments.

Encryption is applied to:

- Bundles
- Event Segments
- Wrapped Keys
- Optional metadata blobs

---

# 7. Nonce Requirements

Nonces MUST be:

- unique per key
- 24 bytes (for XChaCha20-Poly1305)
- generated using a cryptographically secure RNG

Nonce reuse under the same key is strictly prohibited.

---

# 8. Key Model

The system uses a hierarchical key structure:

```
Master Secret
    ↓
Vault Root Key
    ↓
Domain Keys
    ↓
Object or Context Keys
```

Each level is derived or wrapped using HKDF or authenticated wrapping.

---

# 9. Key Derivation

HKDF-SHA256 is used for deterministic derivation of keys.

Inputs include:

- salt
- context string
- parent key

Derived keys MUST be domain-separated.

---

# 10. Key Wrapping

Keys MAY be wrapped using:

- XChaCha20-Poly1305
- AES-KW with a non-exportable 256-bit local device key

Wrapped keys include:

- wrapped key material
- nonce
- associated metadata

The initial browser implementation SHALL store one mandatory local device slot and SHALL NOT store a local passphrase slot.

The device slot SHALL use `wrap:aes-kw-256:device:v1`. Because AES-KW does not accept AAD, a client SHALL authenticate the Vault ID, Device ID, slot ID, wrapping algorithm, and slot version through a Vault verifier derived from the unwrapped Vault Root Key before treating the Vault as unlocked.

Each Vault Package SHALL derive a 32-byte wrapping key from its export passphrase with Argon2id using a random 16-byte salt, 64 MiB memory, and three iterations, then wrap the Vault Root Key using `wrap:xchacha20poly1305:passphrase:v1` and a random 24-byte nonce.

The export key-envelope version, package identifier, Vault identifier, algorithm identifiers, KDF parameters, and Manifest hash SHALL be authenticated as XChaCha20-Poly1305 AAD. This envelope SHALL exist only in the Vault Package and SHALL NOT become a local Vault key slot.

---

# 11. Zero-Knowledge Constraint

The server MUST NOT:

- derive encryption keys
- decrypt any payload
- access plaintext data
- influence key generation

All cryptographic operations occur in trusted clients.

---

# 12. Integrity Model

Integrity is provided by:

- AEAD authentication tags
- SHA-256 checksums (for storage verification)
- optional signatures (for device trust)

---

# 13. Randomness Requirements

All cryptographic randomness MUST be generated using a cryptographically secure RNG provided by the host environment.

---

# 14. Algorithm Agility

All cryptographic components MUST include version identifiers.

The system MUST support coexistence of multiple algorithm versions.

---

# 15. Key Rotation

Keys MAY be rotated.

Rotation MUST NOT invalidate historical data.

Old keys remain valid for decryption of existing objects.

---

# 16. Device Trust

Devices MAY hold wrapped Vault Root Keys.

Devices MAY be revoked via Events.

Revoked devices MUST lose ability to unwrap future keys.

---

# 17. Forward Secrecy (Optional)

Forward secrecy MAY be achieved through periodic key rotation.

---

# 18. Failure Modes

Cryptographic failures MUST result in:

- rejection of the object
- termination of the operation
- logged diagnostic event (if possible)

No partial decryption is permitted.

---

# 19. Invariants

- Plaintext never leaves trusted clients
- Keys are never transmitted in raw form
- Nonces are never reused per key
- All encrypted data is authenticated
- Algorithms are versioned
