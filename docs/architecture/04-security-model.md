# Security Model

**Document:** `architecture/04-security-model.md`

**Status:** Draft

**Owner:** Engineering

**Depends On:**

- architecture/03-zero-knowledge.md

---

# Purpose

This document defines the security architecture of Archive Platform.

It specifies:

- trust relationships
- cryptographic ownership
- key hierarchy
- device authorization
- vault access
- revocation strategy

It intentionally does **not** specify cryptographic algorithms. Those are defined in the Cryptography document.

---

# Security Goals

The platform must ensure:

1. Only trusted devices can decrypt vault contents.
2. The backend cannot decrypt user data.
3. Compromising one device should not permanently compromise a vault.
4. Multiple devices can safely share a vault.
5. Devices can be revoked.
6. Cryptographic material can evolve without redesigning the platform.

# Security Domains

There are three logical trust domains.

```text
                User

                  │

        Trusted Devices

        Chrome
        Firefox
        Desktop
        Mobile

                  │

         Encrypted Transport

                  │

        Coordination Server

                  │

         Object Storage
```

Only trusted devices possess plaintext vault keys.

---

# Identity

A user account represents an authenticated identity.

The account is **not** the cryptographic owner of archived content.

Instead:

```text
User

↓

Membership

↓

Vault
```

This distinction allows future support for:

- shared vaults
- organization vaults
- delegated access

---

# Key Hierarchy

Every key has exactly one responsibility.

```text
Master Secret

↓

Vault Root Key

├── Bundle Key
├── Event Key
├── Artifact Key
└── Metadata Key
```

No key should serve multiple purposes.

---

# Identity Key

The Identity Key uniquely identifies or authenticates a user account.

Responsibilities:

- authenticate vault membership
- establish trust
- sign authorization requests

It does **not** encrypt archive content.

---

# Device Key

Every trusted device generates its own key pair during registration.

The private key never leaves the device.

Responsibilities:

- authenticate the device
- receive encrypted vault keys
- sign synchronization requests

Compromising one device should not expose private keys from other devices.

---

# Vault Root Key

The Vault Root Key is the root encryption key for a Vault.

Responsibilities:

- authorize access to vault contents
- derive or wrap subordinate keys
- enable new devices to access the vault

The Vault Root Key is never stored unencrypted.

---

# Bundle Key

Every Bundle receives its own context-specific encryption key derived from the Vault Root Key using the Bundle ID, Vault ID, domain label, and key version.

Responsibilities:

- encrypt the immutable bundle
- isolate compromise
- enable future key rotation

Bundle Keys are not persisted in the initial implementation. Trusted clients reconstruct them deterministically according to the Key Derivation Specification.

The same pattern applies to Event and Projection keys with distinct domain labels and contexts.

---

# Object Encryption

Bundles are encrypted first.

Only then are they serialized into storage Objects or Blocks.

The storage layer never interprets cryptographic semantics.

Instead:

```text
Bundle

↓

Encrypt

↓

Ciphertext

↓

Store As Objects / Blocks
```

This keeps the storage layer unaware of plaintext semantics.

---

# Device Enrollment

Adding a new device requires authorization from an existing trusted device.

```text
New Device

↓

Generate Device Key Pair

↓

Request Access

↓

Existing Device Approves

↓

Vault Root Key Wrapped For New Device

↓

Synchronization Begins
```

The coordination server relays encrypted messages but cannot read them.

## Initial Local Browser Slot

Before multi-device enrollment exists, the browser Host stores one mandatory local device wrapper for the Vault Root Key using a non-exportable device key. Local onboarding does not create or retain a passphrase wrapper.

Export passphrases protect individual Vault Packages. They are not local unlock credentials, recovery settings, or persistent Vault state.

---

# Device Revocation

Revocation prevents future synchronization.

Revoking a device:

- invalidates its registration
- prevents receiving new vault updates
- prevents uploading new bundles

Revocation **does not** erase previously synchronized local data.

If a device is believed to be compromised, users should rotate the Vault Root Key.

---

# Key Rotation

The architecture supports independent rotation.

Possible rotations:

- Identity Key
- Device Key
- Vault Root Key
- Bundle Keys

Rotating one key should minimize impact on unrelated components.

For example, rotating a Vault Root Key should **not** require re-encrypting every Bundle immediately. Subordinate keys can be rewrapped or rederived gradually according to the cryptography specification.

---

# Authentication vs Encryption

Authentication proves identity.

Encryption protects data.

These are separate concerns.

Examples:

| Action | Authentication | Encryption |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Login | ✓ | ✗ |
| Upload Bundle | ✓ | ✓ |
| Download Bundle | ✓ | ✓ |
| Billing | ✓ | ✗ |

---

# Forward Secrecy

Future versions may support stronger forward secrecy for device-to-device communication.

This is outside the MVP.

---

# Account Recovery

Archive Platform deliberately separates:

- account recovery
- vault recovery

Losing account credentials should not automatically compromise encrypted vault contents.

Possible recovery mechanisms include:

- recovery keys
- recovery devices
- exported vault key packages

No recovery mechanism should require backend access to plaintext vault keys.

This remains an open design area.

---

# Security Events

The system should record security events, including:

- device enrollment
- device revocation
- vault key rotation
- failed authentication
- recovery attempts

Security logs should avoid exposing private archive metadata.

---

# Security Assumptions

The platform assumes:

- operating systems enforce local permissions
- TLS protects transport
- browsers implement WebCrypto correctly
- users protect their devices with OS-level authentication

Compromise of a trusted client falls outside the zero-knowledge guarantees.

---

# Open Questions

Should vault access require approval from one device or multiple devices?

Should enterprise vaults support hardware-backed keys?

Should users be able to export wrapped vault keys?

Should hardware security modules be supported?

These questions are deferred until enterprise features are designed.
