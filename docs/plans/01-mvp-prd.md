# 1. Executive Summary

Archive Platform is a privacy-first, local-first knowledge preservation platform that enables users to permanently archive digital information while retaining complete ownership of their data.

Unlike traditional bookmark managers or note-taking applications, Archive Platform captures complete snapshots of digital content, preserves them as immutable records, enriches them locally using artificial intelligence, and synchronizes encrypted objects across trusted devices.

The platform is built around a zero-knowledge architecture. User content is encrypted before leaving trusted devices, ensuring that the service provider cannot read, analyze, or monetize archived information.

The first release focuses on web page archival through browser extensions. The long-term vision expands to become a general-purpose personal knowledge archive supporting many digital content types.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

The modern web is transient.

Users regularly encounter situations where:

* articles disappear
* documentation changes
* discussions are edited or deleted
* web applications evolve
* URLs become invalid
* images are removed
* embedded media becomes unavailable

Traditional bookmarking systems preserve only links.

Traditional note-taking systems often preserve extracted text but not the original source.

Existing archival solutions either:

* fail to preserve dynamic web content,
* expose user data to centralized services,
* require server-side processing,
* or provide limited search and organization capabilities.

Users need a system that faithfully preserves information while respecting privacy.

---

# 3. Product Vision

Archive Platform enables users to build a permanent digital knowledge library.

Every archived Bundle becomes:

* permanently preserved
* searchable
* available offline
* synchronized securely
* AI-enhanced
* exportable
* user-owned

The platform should become the trusted repository for everything a user wishes to preserve.

---

# 4. Goals

## Primary Goals

### G1 — Faithful Preservation

Capture content with sufficient fidelity that it can be viewed years later even if the original source disappears.

---

### G2 — Privacy

The service provider must not be capable of reading archived content.

---

### G3 — Offline Operation

Users should continue using the product without network connectivity.

---

### G4 — AI Enhancement

Artificial intelligence should improve archived information without compromising privacy.

---

### G5 — Long-Term Durability

Archives should remain accessible regardless of future implementation changes.

---

# 5. Non-Goals

The platform is not intended to replace:

* collaborative documentation platforms
* real-time editors
* project management software
* cloud office suites
* enterprise content management systems

The focus remains knowledge preservation.

# 9. Functional Requirements

## Capture

The system shall:

* capture complete web pages
* capture page metadata
* attempt full-page screenshots and report a warning when the Host cannot produce one
* preserve dynamic DOM state
* preserve page title
* preserve URL
* preserve timestamps
* preserve favicons
* preserve Open Graph metadata

The first `ChromeWebPage-v1` Capture Profile requires non-empty MHTML.

Firefox capture is deferred until after the first Chrome vertical slice and should eventually produce an equivalent self-contained representation.

---

## Local Storage

The client shall maintain a local encrypted Vault replica.

The local archive shall support:

* offline browsing
* offline search
* offline AI
* offline annotations

---

## Search

The client shall provide:

* full-text search

* title search

* URL search

* tag search

* folder search

* AI-assisted semantic search (future)

Search shall not require backend participation.

---

## AI

The client shall support:

* summarization

* automatic tagging

* keyword extraction

* entity extraction

* embeddings

Future AI capabilities should integrate through a provider abstraction.

---

## Synchronization

The platform shall synchronize immutable Bundles, Vault Events, wrapped keys, and coordination metadata between trusted devices.

Synchronization shall:

* resume automatically

* support interrupted uploads

* converge by replaying ordered Events

* synchronize incrementally

* minimize bandwidth

---

## Security

The platform shall:

encrypt before upload

never transmit plaintext

verify object integrity

support device revocation

support encrypted backups

---

# 10. Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance

Archive creation:

Target:

<10 seconds for average pages.

Search:

<100 milliseconds for local queries.

Archive opening:

<500 milliseconds for cached captures.

Synchronization:

Background operation without blocking the UI.

---

## Scalability

The architecture should support:

millions of users

billions of archived objects

petabyte-scale encrypted storage

without architectural redesign.

---

## Reliability

Synchronization failures must never corrupt local archives.

Uploads must be resumable.

Stored Objects must be verifiable using integrity metadata.

---

## Portability

The platform should support:

Chrome

Firefox

Edge

Brave

Safari (future)

Desktop operating systems.

---

# 11. MVP Scope

## Implementation Sequence

The first executable slice is defined by `docs/plans/02-chrome-extension-capture-vertical-slice.md`.

It is Chrome-only and includes Vault onboarding/unlock, mandatory MHTML, best-effort full-page PNG, deterministic encrypted Bundle persistence, `BundleRegistered`, an offline library, and MHTML download. The remaining items below describe the broader public-release target and do not expand that first slice.

The first public release includes:

Browser Extension

* Full-page screenshot
* MHTML (Chrome)
* Self-contained HTML (Firefox)
* Metadata extraction
* Local encrypted storage
* Local search
* Manual tags
* Manual folders
* Notes
* Synchronization
* Multi-device support

Backend

* Authentication
* Multi-tenancy
* Object storage
* Synchronization
* Device registry
* Billing foundation

Excluded:

* Sharing
* OCR
* Scheduled captures
* Mobile applications
* Public archives
* Semantic search
* Browser history import

---

Compression.

Incremental synchronization.

---

## AI evolution

Mitigation:

Provider abstraction.

Regenerable artifacts.

Versioned AI outputs.

---

## Cryptographic mistakes

Mitigation:

Keep cryptography simple.

Use established libraries.

Never invent new algorithms.

Subject cryptographic design to external review before production.

---

# 14. Open Questions

How should encrypted sharing be implemented?

Workspaces expose one device-local active Vault plus an accessible Vault picker in Capture and Library surfaces. Selection is global on the device, persists until changed, locks the previous Vault, and sets the destination for subsequent Captures. Vault names are encrypted Event-derived state with a rebuildable local encrypted cache for locked display.

How should large media files be archived?

Should browser tabs automatically synchronize?

Should archive comparison become a first-class feature?

How should long-term key recovery operate?

These questions are intentionally deferred to later design and specification documents.

---

# 15. Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is considered complete when a user can:

1. Install the browser extension.

2. Create an account.

3. Archive any supported web page.

4. Browse archives offline.

5. Search archives offline.

6. Add notes.

7. Add tags.

8. Synchronize between two devices.

9. Restore a second device from the encrypted cloud backup.

10. Confirm that the backend never possesses plaintext archive contents.

# Appendix A — Product Principles

Every feature should improve at least one of the following:

* Preservation
* Privacy
* Performance
* Portability
* Simplicity

Features that compromise these principles require strong justification.

---

# Appendix B — Future Vision

The architecture should ultimately support a universal encrypted knowledge archive containing:

* Web pages
* PDFs
* Books
* Emails
* Images
* Videos
* Audio
* Source code
* Personal notes
* Research papers
* Office documents
* AI-generated knowledge artifacts

without requiring changes to the platform's core architecture.
