# AWSM — Archive What Should Matter

AWSM is a local-first webpage archival platform with optional zero-knowledge synchronization. It
captures, stores, and presents an archive on the user's device; a Coordination Server is
optional and receives encrypted data rather than plaintext archive content.

AWSM was created for the OpenAI Devpost hackathon from a concern with conventional clipping
services: an archive should not become inaccessible because a provider shuts down, changes
direction, or restricts access, and sensitive captures should not require giving a service provider
plaintext content.

The implementation is pre-release software. It is not currently available from the Chrome Web
Store, and the hosted service is not advertised as a public service.

## What works today

The Chrome extension currently supports:

- local-only setup with no Account or server;
- webpage capture from active HTTP and HTTPS tabs;
- immutable Captures containing MHTML, a full-page screenshot, a thumbnail, extracted text, and
  structured content when each best-effort representation succeeds;
- an encrypted local Vault backed by browser-local storage;
- offline Library browsing, screenshot viewing, text and structure inspection, and MHTML download;
- multiple local Vaults, Vault locking and renaming, Collections, deletion, restoration, and Vault
  Vacuum;
- passphrase-protected Complete Vault Export and Import; and
- optional Account authentication and synchronization of an encrypted Vault Replica through a
  compatible self-hosted Coordination Server.

MHTML is preserved as the primary Capture Artifact and can be downloaded from the Library. AWSM
does not render MHTML inside the Library. The full-page screenshot is previewed in the Capture detail
view, while extracted text and structured content can be inspected there.

Search, AI-generated summaries, tags, embeddings, classifications, annotations, and folders are
not implemented user-facing features. AWSM already preserves normalized text and document structure
as architectural groundwork for future client-side search and derived Artifacts; it does not
present those future capabilities as current behavior.

## Quick start: local-only Chrome extension

### Requirements

- Chrome 116 or newer
- Node.js 22
- Corepack

Clone the repository, install the pinned dependencies, and build the extension:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parasquid/awsm.git
cd awsm
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm build
```

Load the build in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Select **Load unpacked**.
4. Choose `apps/browser-extension/.output/chrome-mv3`.
5. Pin AWSM from Chrome's Extensions menu.
6. Open AWSM and select **Continue without sync**.
7. Name and create a local Vault.

AWSM is now ready to capture without an Account or Coordination Server. For installation from a
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/parasquid/awsm/releases/latest), download the latest Chrome ZIP
and its SHA-256 checksum. See the
[Chrome extension installation guide](docs/guides/install-chrome-extension.md) for checksum
verification, unpacked installation, upgrades, and troubleshooting.

## Try a Capture

No seeded sample data is required. AWSM creates its sample data by capturing a live HTTP or HTTPS
page.

1. Open a webpage in Chrome.
2. Open the AWSM toolbar popup.
3. Select **Archive this page**.
4. Wait for the **Archived:** preview card.
5. Open that card or select **Open library**.
6. Open the Capture to view its full-page screenshot and Artifact list.
7. Select **Inspect** for extracted text or structured content, or **Download** for MHTML.

The Devpost demonstration uses this CNN article:

<https://edition.cnn.com/2026/07/20/science/pompeii-survivors-docuseries>

If that page is unavailable or does not capture reliably, use the equivalent Science News article:

<https://www.sciencenews.org/article/pompeii-documentary-tom-hiddleston>

These links are demonstration inputs, not repository fixtures, and may change independently of
AWSM.

### Verify offline behavior

After a successful Capture:

1. Disconnect Chrome or the machine from the network.
2. Close or reload the original webpage to confirm it is unavailable.
3. Open the AWSM Library.
4. Open the saved Capture.
5. View and scroll the full-page screenshot.
6. Inspect the extracted text or structured content.
7. Download the locally stored MHTML if desired.

Core archive functionality remains available because the Capture and its local Artifacts do not
depend on a server. A user who explicitly applies synchronized storage relief can remove local MHTML
and screenshot wrappers after AWSM verifies their encrypted server copies. Those remote-only
Artifacts require the configured Account and a network connection until retrieved again; compact
Library data remains local.

## Optional self-hosted synchronization

The local client is the primary application. Synchronization is an optional coordination layer for
encrypted data between devices.

Start the development Coordination Server and PostgreSQL with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The server is then available at <http://localhost:3000>. In AWSM, choose self-hosted
synchronization, enter that origin, grant Chrome access to it, and create an Account. See the
[Coordination Server development guide](apps/coordination-server/README.md) for operations and
troubleshooting.

The client encrypts Vault content before transmission. The server stores opaque encrypted Objects,
Events, Artifacts, and wrapped keys; it does not receive the keys needed to decrypt plaintext Vault
content. The current pre-release implementation does not include device signing and revocation,
Account Recovery Keys, password changes, production quotas, billing, shared object storage, or
production deployment hardening.

## Development

Use the repository-pinned pnpm through Corepack:

```bash
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm test:integration
corepack pnpm test:e2e
```

Create a distributable Chrome ZIP with:

```bash
corepack pnpm zip
```

The repository is organized as follows:

```text
apps/browser-extension/     Chrome Host, Runtime, local storage, and user interface
apps/coordination-server/   Rails coordination service for opaque encrypted data
docs/architecture/          architectural intent and system boundaries
docs/specifications/        formal formats, protocols, and Runtime contracts
docs/plans/                 approved implementation plans and TDD evidence
```

Product intent begins in [VISION.md](VISION.md). Architectural constraints are defined by the
[design principles](docs/architecture/00-design-principles.md), and canonical terminology is in the
[glossary](docs/architecture/glossary.md).

## How OpenAI tools were used

AWSM was developed as a human-directed, AI-assisted project. The product problem, privacy goals,
local-first requirements, architectural decisions, and acceptance of the resulting behavior were
provided and reviewed by the project author. OpenAI tools supported the work end to end:

- **Planning and design:** GPT-5.6 in ChatGPT helped turn the initial product idea into requirements,
  implementation plans, architecture documents, specifications, threat boundaries, and explicit
  acceptance criteria.
- **Implementation:** Codex implemented the browser extension, local Runtime and storage Drivers,
  cryptographic workflows, Coordination Server, synchronization protocol, and user-facing flows
  under the author's direction and review.
- **Testing and debugging:** Codex developed unit, browser integration, packaged-extension
  end-to-end, multi-replica synchronization, failure-injection, and recovery tests; investigated
  failures; and iterated on implementations until the required behavior was demonstrated.
- **Privacy and consistency review:** GPT-5.6 and Codex helped trace changes across architecture,
  formal contracts, implementation, tests, and operations so that plaintext remained inside trusted
  clients and superseded pre-release behavior was not retained as compatibility code.
- **Product and UI refinement:** Codex iterated on onboarding, capture feedback, Library and Artifact
  presentation, responsive layouts, accessibility, error states, and rendered visual checks based on
  author guidance.
- **Delivery:** Codex helped build the development environment, packaging and release validation,
  GitHub Actions CI/CD, installation documentation, and the Devpost demo narrative.

The tools accelerated design, implementation, review, and iteration; they did not replace human
product direction or responsibility for the project's decisions and claims.

## Design principles

- **Local first:** Captures are created, encrypted, stored, and viewed on the client.
- **Cloud optional:** A Coordination Server synchronizes encrypted data but is not required for core
  archive use.
- **Preserve first, interpret later:** Original source Artifacts are retained independently from
  future derived interpretations.
- **Immutable originals:** Captures and their authoritative Objects are not edited in place.
- **No plaintext server dependency:** The server must not require plaintext user content or
  unwrapped Vault keys.

AWSM treats a web Capture as one immutable Bundle graph. Its MHTML, screenshot, thumbnail,
normalized text, and structured content are independently encrypted Artifacts. This preserves the
source while supporting bounded-memory storage, integrity verification, portable Complete Export
and Import, and future locally derived capabilities.

## Release process

Maintainers publish validated Chrome artifacts from version tags:

1. Update `version` in `apps/browser-extension/package.json`.
2. Commit and push the change to `main`.
3. Create and push the matching `v<version>` tag.
4. Wait for the Chrome Extension Release workflow to validate and publish the Release.

Versions ending in `-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, or `-rc.N` create prereleases. Plain versions create
stable Releases. The workflow does not move or overwrite an existing tag or Release.
